# BaseWeedPlugin

Requires bepinex on unity game: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

This is a base mod source code that you can compile using visual studio and then use that .dll to make yo own mod

This is going to be a rough start of a guide, but atleast if you are savvy enough to learn Unity and Bepinex, of course that C#. Then you will be able to getting moddin on the way by just lookin a the source code ! 

Few things this mod does an example:
: Gets the player gameobject and interacts with it by making its local scale Y bigger (LeftControl enables / RightControl disables)
: Patches the bootPC where it doesn't load at all 
: Pressing the Down Arrow key, will create a canvas element that says "TEST" woot
: Number 8 on the keyboard will load an empty weed terrain scene, perfect for testing.
